REM A simple program to shut down reactors when their health of cryofluid amount dips too low
LET reactor = reactor1

LET enoughHealth = reactor.health >= reactor.maxHealth / 2
LET enoughCryofluid = reactor.cryofluid >= reactor.liquidCapacity

IF NOT(enoughHealth AND enoughCryofluid) THEN
    reactor.enabled = false
ELSE
    reactor.enabled = true
END IF
