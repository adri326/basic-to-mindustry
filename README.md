# BASIC to Mindustry logic

This is a small transpiler from the [BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC) language to [Mindustry](https://github.com/Anuken/Mindustry/)'s [logic system](https://www.reddit.com/r/Mindustry/comments/kfea1e/an_overly_indepth_logic_guide/) (also known as `mlog`).
Basic is chosen as the source language as it already contains jumps (which mindustry heavily relies on), while allowing for some higher-order constructs like conditions, loops and functions.

For now this is a heavily work-in-progress project.
